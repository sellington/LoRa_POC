# LoRa POC Project Status

Last Updated: 2025-03-01 (10:21 PM)

## Project Overview
This is a Proof of Concept implementation for a long-range communication system using LoRa technology with ESP32-S3 and Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3 boards. The project includes a remote device powered by solar panels and a base station for collecting and displaying data.

## Current Status
- Overall progress: Phase 1 - Initial Setup (100%)
- Current focus: Phase 2 - Implementing LoRa communication with bidirectional functionality
- Hardware initialization now working correctly (LoRa, Display, Power Management)
- Remote device can send messages but is not receiving acknowledgments

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Created project plan and architecture
- [x] Defined hardware configuration
- [x] Outlined software architecture
- [x] Established project structure
- [x] Set up PlatformIO configuration
- [x] Created initial source files for remote device
- [x] Created initial source files for base station
- [x] Implemented basic documentation

- [x] Created diagnostics for SPI and LoRa module testing
- [x] Added Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3 specific configuration
- [x] Developed low-level GPIO tests to verify hardware functionality
- [x] Created pin discovery test to systematically evaluate all possible pin combinations
- [x] Examined the official schematic to verify pin assignments
- [x] Successfully identified correct pins for LoRa communication
- [x] Resolved packet transmission issues by using correct pin configuration
- [x] Created confirmed working LoRa test program

## In Progress
- [ ] Implementing LoRa-based communication protocol between devices
- [ ] Integrating power management features for remote device

## Next Steps
- Test communication between remote device and base station
- Implement power management for the remote device
- Set up OLED displays for both devices
- Integrate working LoRa configuration into other project components

## Hardware Components
- Both MakerFocus ESP32-S3 and Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3 boards for testing
- OLED displays
- Solar panels for remote device
- LiPo batteries

## Software Components
- PlatformIO with Arduino framework
- RadioLib and sandeepmistry/LoRa libraries for LoRa communication
- Adafruit SSD1306 for OLED displays
- ArduinoJson for data handling

## Known Issues
- RESOLVED: Found that original pins from schematic (13, 14) are correct and working
- RESOLVED: Packet transmission successful with original pin configuration 
- RESOLVED: SX1262 chip identification error fixed by correcting class type
- RESOLVED: I2C display pins updated to correct values (18-SCL, 17-SDA) for Heltec board
- PENDING: Remote device sends messages but doesn't receive acknowledgments
- PENDING: Base station may not be listening or responding to messages

## Notes from Last Session
- Fixed critical errors in the LoRa communication code:
  - Changed SX1276 to SX1262 in both header and implementation files (important!)
  - Updated the LoRa parameters to match our working test configuration:
    - Maximum bandwidth (500 kHz instead of 125 kHz)
    - Minimum spreading factor (6 instead of 10)
    - Correct sync word (0x34 instead of 0x12)
    - Lower power (2 dBm instead of 17 dBm)
  - Applied these changes to both remote_device and base_station implementations
  
- Fixed display initialization issues:
  - Updated OLED display pins in both remote and base station code
  - Changed SCL pin from 22 to 18 (correct for Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3)
  - Changed SDA pin from 21 to 17 (correct for Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3)
  
- Current progress testing:
  - Remote device now successfully initializes all hardware:
    - Power management system working correctly
    - LoRa module initializing without errors
    - Display initializing correctly
    - Metrics system operating as expected
  - Remote device is sending messages but timing out waiting for acknowledgments
  - Remote device properly enters sleep mode after sending attempts
  
- Possible causes for the acknowledgment issue:
  - Base station may not be receiving messages (check frequency and sync word)
  - Base station may not be sending acknowledgments (check ack functionality)
  - Reception parameters may need adjustment (spreading factor, bandwidth)
  - Signal may be too weak for reliable two-way communication (adjust power/antenna)

- Next steps for future sessions:
  - Focus on bidirectional communication between devices
  - Verify base station is properly configured to receive and acknowledge messages
  - Test devices in close proximity to rule out signal strength issues
  - Potentially add debug messages to help trace communication flow
  - Once basic communication works, optimize for power and range
